        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Below is my online resume. I am a physicist working in dr. prof. Rainer Kaltenbaek's Quantum Optics group in Ljubljana.
			Currently, I am working on generating and teleporting narrowband entanglement. This will be show for the 1st time in Ljubljana between the Faculty
			of Mathematics and Physics, and the Jozef Stefan Institute. Since arriving here in April of 2023, I have designed, created and optimized a 
			Sagnac source of entanglemed. Now we are working on teleportation.
			It is a fairly new laboratory and so there is much to build and learn from Rainer and the rest of the team.</p>

            <h3>Physics Researcher and PhD Candidate</h3>
            <p>Faculty of Mathematics and Physics | April 2023 - Present</p>
				<p>Built a Sagnac source of Entanglement. Maintaining various lab equipment and software. Here I am comfortably learning about Quantum Optics, Nonlinear</p>
				<p>	optics, Quantum Communication, as well as many other fields in Physics. Comming from a Solid State Physics background I was at first overwhelemed by the </p>
				<p>level of knowledge I'd have to learn, but I believe that I have quickly mastered the basics as well as many advanced ideas in these fields. </p>

            <h3>Software engineer</h3>
            <p>OTP Bank Zadar | February - March 2023</p>
				<p>I implemented an optimization to increase transaction accuaracy and reduce the delay between each, thus increasing the base performance of the codebase.</p>
				<p>Here I learned how to build minimal applications for testing features.</p>

            <h3>Tutor</h3>
            <p>Rijeka | 2014 - 2022</p>
				<p>Tutoring in Physics, Mathematics, Programming, and Latin for elementary schools students, high school students, and college students.</p>
				<p>During these years I learned many teaching skills. I've dealt with many children who had no interest in the subjects they were coming to see me for,</p>
				<p>and I believe I left them with a good set of skills that they will carry for the rest of their life.</p>
